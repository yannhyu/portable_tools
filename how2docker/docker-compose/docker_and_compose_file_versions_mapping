All formats

Added a new docker-compose images command that lists images used by
the current project's containers

Added a --stop (shorthand -s) option to docker-compose rm that stops
the running containers before removing them

Added a --resolve-image-digests option to docker-compose config that
pins the image version for each service to a permanent digest

Added a --exit-code-from SERVICE option to docker-compose up. When
used, docker-compose will exit on any container's exit with the code
corresponding to the specified service's exit code

Added a --parallel option to docker-compose pull that enables images
for multiple services to be pulled simultaneously

Added a --build-arg option to docker-compose build

Added a --volume <volume_mapping> (shorthand -v) option to
docker-compose run to declare runtime volumes to be mounted

Added a --project-directory PATH option to docker-compose that will
affect path resolution for the project

When using --abort-on-container-exit in docker-compose up, the exit
code for the container that caused the abort will be the exit code of
the docker-compose up command

Users can now configure which path separator character they want to use
to separate the COMPOSE_FILE environment value using the
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR environment variable

Added support for port range to single port in port mappings
(e.g. 8000-8010:80)
