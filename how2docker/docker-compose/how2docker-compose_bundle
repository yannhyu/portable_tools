Developers can use Docker Compose 1.8 to create DABs from docker-compose.yml files and ops can use Docker 1.12 to deploy apps by creating stacks of services from DABs.

To create a DAB, a developer or CI system uses Compose to package up an app:

$ docker-compose build
...
$ docker-compose push
...
$ docker-compose bundle
Wrote bundle to example.dab

The ops team can then deploy the DAB on Docker 1.12:

$ docker deploy example
Loading bundle from example.dab
Creating network app-network
Creating service example-db
Creating service example-web
