Remember, a pull is a fetch and a merge. * `git pull origin master` fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out.

git pull is the same as git fetch + git merge

The command

git pull <remote> <branch>
is really just the same as

git fetch <remote>
git merge <remote>/<branch>
So there is no practical difference between

git pull origin master
and

git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
