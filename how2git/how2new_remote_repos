git push -u origin master



upstream generally refers to the original repo that you have forked from;
(see also "Definition of “downstream” and “upstream”" for more on upstream term)

origin is your fork: your own repo on GitHub, clone of the original repo of GitHub

git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
# Sets the new remote
git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin

git remote add creates a remote, which is a shorthand name for another repository.  git branch --set-upstream-to sets a branch to be tracked by the branch in the remote repository specified.

What you are wanting to do is track a remote branch, which is done with git branch --set-upstream-to or more simply git branch -u.

when you clone a repository from another, a remote is created named origin and the branch master is checked out. 
The command to have your local branch master track the remote branch master is 
    git branch -u origin/master, 
and is executed from the local master branch.
