Keeping your master up-to-date!

Once all this is done, youâ€™ll be able to keep your local master up to date with the simple command:

$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase


git pull = git fetch + git merge against tracking upstream branch;
git pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase against tracking upstream branch
